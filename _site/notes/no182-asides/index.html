<li>🤩 🌳 💥 Loads of information in an accessible form in Céline Keller’s Comic, <a href="https://www.celinekeller.com/discourses-of-climate-delay">Discourses of Climate Delay</a> <em>“This is a comic adaption of the ‘Discourses of Climate Delay’ study by the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC). I used the quotes from their supplementary materials and added some extra examples with context information gathered mostly from the fantastic Climate Disinformation Database at Desmog.”</em> (Via <a href="https://twitter.com/bopuc">Bopuc</a>.)</li>
<li>👀 🏙 🇨🇳 One of the things I have in mind when I say “synthetic reality.” <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2021/07/09/digital-twins-develop-cities-digital-design-architecture/">Digital twins offer “a very powerful way of developing our cities”</a>. <em>“The technology, which involves creating a digital clone of a real-world object or system, is revolutionising the fields of healthcare, manufacturing and logistics. It is now having a profound impact on architecture and urbanism too.”</em></li>
<li>🇳🇿 🌳 🐸 👍🏼 <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210527-zealandia-new-zealands-nature-reserve-with-a-500-year-plan">The nature reserve with a 500-year plan</a>. <em>”Zealandia is a perfect example of a living laboratory that can be a boon for conservation research, even within cities. ‘It’s a place where restoration techniques can be trialled, which is important for advancing conservation management outside of these areas,’ Stanley says. ‘It’s also an accessible way for the public to see research in action.’”</em> (Via <a href="https://twitter.com/eliotpeper">Eliot Peper</a>)</li>
<li>👽 <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkbq7z/nasa-is-quietly-funding-a-hunt-for-alien-megastructures">NASA Is Quietly Funding a Hunt for Alien Megastructures</a>. <em>“The strategy for the team’s survey is to “search for the weird,” Croft said–simply, light curves that lack good explanations. The difficulty is in the sheer size of the data. The team is developing machine learning pipelines to automatically classify the millions of light variations that TESS will pick up. The aim is to create algorithms good enough to sort most of these into known causes, such as transiting exoplanets, allowing the researchers to focus on the cases that truly stand out.”</em></li>
<li>🦠 🧰 🤯<a href="https://twitter.com/BanfieldJill/status/1414647658786922496">Imagine a strange foreign entity, neither alive nor dead, that assimilates and shares important genes… A floating toolbox, likely full of blueprints, some that we may one day harness, like CRISPR…</a></li>
<li>🌎 🤔 <a href="http://jreynolds.org/2021/07/13/earth-system-interventions-for-sustainability/">Earth System Interventions for Sustainability</a>. <em>“In my research on solar geoengineering, carbon dioxide removal, and gene drives, I began to wonder whether these proposed technologies are–as many claim–fundamental breaks from past activities or merely additional points along a continuum, albeit somewhat further out.”</em></li>
<li>🤑 It’s at Andreessen Horowitz so be warned, but long list I intend to look at more throughly at some point. <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/04/02/nfts-readings-resources/">NFT Canon</a> <em>“It’s a curated list of readings and resources on all things NFTs, and is organized from the big picture of what NFTs are and why they matter to how to mint, collect, and do more with them — including FAQs, ecosystem overviews, and various applications such as art, music, gaming, social tokens, creator DAOs, and others.”</em></li>
<li>🇨🇳 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/08/business/china-mao.html">Why China’s Young People Are Embracing Chairman Mao</a>. <em>“Chairman Mao is making a comeback among China’s Generation Z. The Communist Party’s supreme leader, whose decades of nonstop political campaigns cost millions of lives, is inspiring and comforting disaffected people born long after his death in 1976. To them, Mao Zedong is a hero who speaks to their despair as struggling nobodies.”</em></li>
