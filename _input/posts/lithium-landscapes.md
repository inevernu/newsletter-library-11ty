The environmental impacts of lithium extraction are getting quite well known. This paper by Samir Bhowmik fleshes out some more context in terms of the places themselves, “deep time and multi-scalar topologies” and frames the whole supply chain and products within the visual culture of lithium, which is clouded in utopian dreams and abstractions of energy sufficiency. “These representations are largely immaterial and dimensionless, making the true scope and scale of lithium-based energy systems impossible to grasp.”

> [W]ith every such interaction, “a vast matrix of capacities is invoked: interlaced chains of resource extraction, human labor and algorithmic processing across networks of mining, logistics, distribution, processing, prediction, and optimization.” Crawford and Joler argue the scale of this system is almost beyond human imagining.
