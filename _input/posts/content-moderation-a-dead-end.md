When Microsoft couldn’t solve it’s malware problem through more security, a changing model of computing (more mobile and cloud) helped the issue. Perhaps social, and specifically Facebook, can’t solve anything through more moderation, and we ‘just’ need a new model. (Perhaps something like the [dark forest](https://sentiers.media/tags/dark_forest/)?)
> We can try to control that, but perhaps a certain level of bad behaviour on the internet and on social might just be inevitable, and we have to decide what we want, just as we did for cars or telephones - we require seat belts and safety standards, and speed limits, but don’t demand that cars be unable to exceed the speed limit.
