Short answer: to research how microbes function in space and better understand how our own trillions of bacteria will react on longer journeys.
> Inhabiting a specialized light organ within the squid's mantle cavity, vibrio cause their bobtail hosts to glow at night in a way that mimics downwelling starlight, preventing the squid from casting a shadow and making them harder for predators to spot.
