- The [archive](/newsletter/) of every issue of the newsletter.
- The “[library](/notes/)” which is something like a digital garden and consists of an interlinked repository of every piece of every newsletter issue. Under the current format, there are usually 4-5 featured articles per issue and a section of short asides, each with an opinion / summary / synthesis I've written. In the library, each of these becomes a “note,” to which I add constantly, independently of what's in the weekly.
- As inspiration and time allows, there are also articles that make their way on the site.
